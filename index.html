   <h2>Brea, CA</h2>
   <p>My best friend lives in Brea and so I try to visit as often as I can. The weather is always perfect, I love checking out all the various plants that are native to the area, and enjoy time with my friend.</p>

   <h2>Okeene, OK</h2>
   <p>My family is from the Oklahoma region. I love the wide open spaces, the serenity of the rural life, and the kindness of the people here.</p>

   <h2>Virginia Beach, VA</h2>
   <p>I have family who resides in Virginia Beach, which makes it a top destination. I love walking along the boardwalk by the beach, discovering amazing restaurants, and spending time with the people I love.</p>
